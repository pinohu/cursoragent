# Automation Requirements for Cursor Composer Workflow

Based on the research conducted on Cursor Composer and its capabilities, this document outlines the specific requirements needed to automate the entire process from idea to application deployment without human intervention.

## Core Requirements

1. **Automated Cursor Installation and Configuration**
   - Ability to install Cursor programmatically
   - Configure Cursor settings for optimal automation
   - Set up Agent mode as the default mode

2. **Idea Input Mechanism**
   - Define a standardized format for idea input (JSON, YAML, or text)
   - Create a mechanism to receive and parse idea descriptions
   - Convert idea descriptions into Cursor Composer prompts

3. **Cursor Composer Interaction**
   - Programmatically launch Cursor
   - Trigger Composer in Agent mode (CMD+I or CMD+SHIFT+I)
   - Input prompts without human intervention
   - Monitor Composer's progress and status

4. **Terminal Command Execution**
   - Allow Cursor Agent to execute necessary terminal commands
   - Handle command execution permissions and confirmations
   - Capture and process command outputs

5. **Multi-file Management**
   - Track files created and modified by Composer
   - Organize project structure automatically
   - Handle file dependencies and relationships

6. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Detect and respond to errors during the automation process
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Log errors and provide diagnostic information

7. **Testing Integration**
   - Automatically run tests on generated code
   - Validate application functionality
   - Fix issues identified during testing

8. **Deployment Automation**
   - Package the application for deployment
   - Configure deployment settings
   - Execute deployment to target environment
   - Verify successful deployment

9. **Notification System**
   - Provide status updates throughout the process
   - Notify upon completion or failure
   - Include deployment details and access information

## Technical Requirements

1. **cursor-tools Integration**
   - Install and configure cursor-tools CLI
   - Utilize cursor-tools for enhanced automation capabilities
   - Leverage browser automation features for deployment verification

2. **Scripting Environment**
   - Node.js environment for automation scripts
   - Required libraries and dependencies
   - Configuration management

3. **Process Orchestration**
   - Workflow management to coordinate all steps
   - State persistence between steps
   - Parallel processing where applicable

4. **Input/Output Handling**
   - Standardized input formats
   - Structured output formats
   - Logging and reporting mechanisms

5. **Security Considerations**
   - Secure handling of API keys and credentials
   - Permission management
   - Secure deployment practices

## Integration Requirements

1. **Operating System Integration**
   - Support for macOS, Windows, and Linux
   - Handle OS-specific behaviors and commands
   - Manage environment variables and system paths

2. **Version Control Integration**
   - Initialize and manage Git repositories
   - Commit changes at appropriate stages
   - Push to remote repositories if needed

3. **Deployment Platform Integration**
   - Support for multiple deployment targets (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS)
   - Handle platform-specific deployment requirements
   - Manage deployment configurations

## Constraints and Limitations

1. **Cursor Limitations**
   - Limited API for programmatic control
   - Dependency on keyboard shortcuts for some operations
   - Potential need for simulated user interactions

2. **Resource Constraints**
   - CPU and memory requirements for Cursor and automation scripts
   - Network bandwidth for deployment
   - Storage requirements for projects

3. **Timing Considerations**
   - Variable processing times for different project types
   - Potential timeouts during long-running operations
   - Synchronization between different automation components

## Success Criteria

The automation solution will be considered successful if it can:

1. Accept an idea description as input
2. Automatically process the idea through Cursor Composer
3. Generate a functional application without human intervention
4. Deploy the application to a specified target
5. Provide access details for the deployed application
6. Complete the entire process reliably and consistently

These requirements will guide the design and development of the automation solution for Cursor Composer workflow.
