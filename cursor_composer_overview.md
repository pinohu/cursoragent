# Cursor Composer Research Findings

## What is Cursor Composer?

Cursor Composer is a feature of the Cursor AI code editor that enables users to build full applications from instructions. It has progressed Cursor's AI code assistance from just editing single lines of code and individual pages to editing and creating multiple files at once.

Key features of Cursor Composer include:
- Multi-file editing capabilities
- End-to-end task completion
- Terminal command execution
- Agent mode for autonomous operation

## Accessing Cursor Composer

Cursor Composer can be accessed through keyboard shortcuts:
- **CMD+I**: Opens Cursor in a floating window that can be resized and moved around
- **CMD+SHIFT+I**: Opens the full screen Cursor with 3 panels (progress panel, central file section, and chat panel)

Since Cursor 0.40, Composer is turned on by default, but it can also be turned on and off from Cursor Settings.

## Agent Mode

Cursor Composer has an "Agent mode" that can complete tasks end-to-end. This mode gives the AI more autonomy, allowing it to:
- Pull context automatically
- Run terminal commands
- Plan and execute complex tasks
- Make multi-file edits

Agent mode can be selected from the mode picker in Composer or by using the shortcut `âŒ˜.` to switch between modes during a conversation.

## Automation Capabilities

Cursor Composer can be enhanced with additional tools for automation:

### cursor-tools CLI

`cursor-tools` is a CLI tool that can be installed globally to expand Cursor Agent's capabilities. It provides:
- Web search capabilities via Perplexity
- Repository context handling via Gemini 2.0
- Browser automation via Stagehand
- GitHub integration
- Documentation generation
- Direct model queries

The CLI can be installed with:
```
npm install -g cursor-tools
cursor-tools install .
```

### Automation Potential

Based on the research, there are several approaches to automating Cursor Composer:

1. **Using Agent Mode**: Cursor's Agent mode already provides automation capabilities, allowing the AI to complete tasks end-to-end with minimal human intervention.

2. **cursor-tools Integration**: The cursor-tools CLI can be used to enhance Cursor Agent with additional capabilities and automate various aspects of the workflow.

3. **Command Line Execution**: Cursor can automatically write and run terminal commands, which could be leveraged for automation.

4. **Rules System**: Cursor has a rules system that can direct the Agent with specific instructions based on glob patterns.

## Limitations and Challenges

Some potential limitations and challenges for full automation include:

1. **Initial Setup**: Cursor and cursor-tools need to be installed and configured properly.

2. **Human Intervention Points**: While Agent mode can work autonomously, there may still be points where human intervention is expected or required.

3. **API Limitations**: There doesn't appear to be a comprehensive public API for programmatically controlling all aspects of Cursor.

4. **Keyboard Shortcut Dependency**: Many interactions with Cursor rely on keyboard shortcuts, which may be challenging to automate without a proper API.

## Next Steps for Automation

To create a fully automated workflow from idea to deployment using Cursor Composer:

1. Identify specific automation requirements and workflow steps
2. Design an automation architecture that leverages Cursor's Agent mode and cursor-tools
3. Develop scripts to handle the entire process without human intervention
4. Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Test the automation solution with various scenarios
6. Document the solution and its usage
